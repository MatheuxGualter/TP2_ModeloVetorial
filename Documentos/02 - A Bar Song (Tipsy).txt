My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em: Bring another round, we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

I've been boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (oh, Lord), I
Woke up drunk at ten AM
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh, Lord

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em: Bring another round, we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (we go way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street (downtown)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (at the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (tell 'em drinks on me)

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street (come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (woo-ooh)

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (it's Jack D)
At the bottom of a bottle, don't miss me (baby, don't miss me)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

(That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out of the bar)
